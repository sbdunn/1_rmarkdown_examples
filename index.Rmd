# Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

## Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

### Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



### Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


### Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```



## DyGraph example. 

### Discharge Graph with Points
```{r}
dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)")  %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2)

```


## Poudre River Discharge

The *Cache La Poudre River* flows east from the continental divide before joining the *Platte River* on the Colorado plains. Discharge is highly seasonal, reflecting the driving influences of precipitation and water consumption in the watershed. **Snowfall** in the winter months increases snow pack in the high mountains and is released in spring causing a dramatic and sustained spike in discharge. Flashy summer **monsoons** generate smaller peaks. High intensity and localized rain storms deliver high volumes of water to tributaries; these pulses become muted further downstream as the flow is integrated into the system. **Consumptive** water use for irrigation and drinking water supply, as well as **evapotranspiration** along the river corridor represent a major loss from the Poudre. Flows are consisently low in Fort Collins through much of the summer and fall.
